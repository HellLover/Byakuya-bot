## Byakuya
Byakuya is a kind of tutorial bot written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for begginers to start with. It uses `discord.js v14.6.0`.

The main idea of this project is to create a Discord bot and a website/dashboard with TypeScript and NestJS for those who want to learn coding such things.
