## Byakuya
Byakuya is a kind of tutorial bot written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for begginers to start with. It uses `discord.js v14.6.0`.

The main idea of this project is to create a Discord bot and a website/dashboard with TypeScript and NestJS for those who want to learn coding such things.

## Getting Started
`#1` Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
`#2` Fork this repository and run it on your machine:
  ↳ `#2.1` If you are using `npm`, run `npm install` or `yarn add` if using `yarn`.;
  ↳ `#2.2` Run `npm run start` to trigger the script placed in `package.json` and to start the project.
`#3` Configure your own `.env` file:
  ↳ `#3.1` Change the `.env.example` file to `.env`;
  ↳ `#3.2` Change `OWNER` to your own Discord ID;
  ↳ `#3.3` Change `BYAKUYA_TOKEN` to your bot's token. You can change the variable name if you wish to;
  ↳ `#3.4` Change `BYAKUYA_ID`  to your bot's ID. You can change the variable name if you wish to;
  ↳ `#3.5` Change `DEV_MODE` to `false` if your bot is public and if you want the slash-commands to be registered globally.

Please use this repository if you have at least a little knowledge of how to create bots and how to code.


If you see this on your console - congratulations, you've done everything right and your bot is working!
